This is an e-mail client that was coded in Python 2.7. Unfortunately it does not work anymore because the Python instance does not offer any security, so the e-mail server rejects the connection. It has worked in the past when security was not as tight, but now it is instantly rejected. Encryption has not yet been implemented, and is in development. However, the thought process for encryption is a simple algorithm where a letter corresponds to another or corresponds to a special character. For testing purposes, the username is: radu@yahoo.ca, and the password is 123. To run this program, please compile and run EmailClient.py using a Python 2.7 IDE like Portable Python 2.7, which can be found here: http://ftp.heanet.ie/pub/portablepython/v2.7/PortablePython_2.7.6.1.exe.
